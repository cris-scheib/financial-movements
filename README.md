# Financial movements

A small project to keep track of cash inflows and outflows. The project is separated in two parts, the API and the APP (Application).

### API

Developed with the [AdonisJs Framework](https://adonisjs.com/), the API is the backend of the project. That's where the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) is implemented, as well the user authentication. 

### APP
